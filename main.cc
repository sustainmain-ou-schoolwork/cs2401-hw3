/*************************************************************************
	This is the main for Project 3, which asks you to build a container 
	that holds a list of assignments you are waiting to complete.

    The Assignments are always kept in order, so they never need to be 
    sorted since they are always inserted in the order where they go. 
    You will also need the files:
	datetime.h
	datetime.cc
	assignment.h
	assignment.cc
	node.h
    in order to do this project. You will be writing both the .h
    and the .cc file for the container.
